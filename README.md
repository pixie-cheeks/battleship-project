# Project: Battleship

As part of TOP's curriculum, this project is about practicing writing tests. This should make the code modular and easier to organize.

## Building the Game

This project uses `pnpm` but `npm` should work too. Though I do recommend using `pnpm` for faster install and saving disk space.

To install `pnpm` run this command:

```shell
npm install --global pnpm
```

First, you need to clone the repo. Once that's done, install the dependencies and run the build script.

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

## Conclusion

Extremely disappointed by myself. Barely managed to finish the project due to
procrastination. Was hoping for perfection at the start, but sadly I don't have
time to procrastinate over a small project for so long.
